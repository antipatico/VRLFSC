This "program" was created by <YOUR_NAME>, thus all the rights are holded by

3. Not give it to other people.

bank coordinates included) and eventually sell it to third parties (yet to be
defined).
6. Install additional software at anytime, no matter what's the usage of the
software installed itself, with software intending ANY kind of software (from
firmware to applications). This allowance is granted on ANY of your device and
can happen at ANY time, without notification due.

The access is granted through identity, every service that is linked to your

Just kidding, you can do whatever you want with this source-code. I don't give

I'm working on it on my spare time. Thus the software comes with *NO WARRANTY*.
Take in consideration the possibility to offer me a beer.
